**🚀 Mastering Static Website Hosting with Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudShell 🌐**


In today’s digital age, having a fast, reliable, and cost-effective website is essential for anyone looking to build an online presence—whether it’s for a personal blog, a portfolio, or a business landing page. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) offers an excellent solution for hosting static websites with unparalleled scalability, durability, and ease of use.


**These are the steps that I have taken in this project:**

✅ Create and Configure S3 Bucket:

Created an S3 bucket, and ensured that the bucket was configured for static website hosting by enabling the feature under the bucket properties.

✅ Upload Your Website Files:

Uploaded a CSS template into the S3 bucket using Amazon CloudShell.

Amazon S3’s intuitive interface makes managing your files and folders easy.

✅ Enable Static Website Hosting:

Specified the index.html file as my default landing page. 

✅ Set Permissions for Public Access:

Modified the bucket policy to allow public access to your content. This step is crucial for making our website accessible to everyone.

✅ Open Using Browser:

Copied the object URL and opened it using browser.



Amazon S3 takes the complexity out of website hosting, allowing us to focus on delivering great content while AWS manages the infrastructure. Whether we’re a developer, a small business owner, or an IT professional, S3 is a powerful tool in our digital toolbox.
